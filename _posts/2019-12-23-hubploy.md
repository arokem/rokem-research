title:  "Setting up hubploy for Jupyterhub"

Last week, Yuvi Panda spent the week here at eScience. This was an opportunity
to overhaul the way in which the learning-2-learn Jupyterhub is deployed and the
way in which work is distributed in this hub. Until now, deployment was done "by
hand": every time an update had to be done, I would edit the relevant
configuration file (e.g., the Dockerfile containing the specification of the
computational environment, or the yaml files setting the jupyterhub
configuration) and then deploy an update. To automate this process, Yuvi has
developed [`hubploy`](https://github.com/yuvipanda/hubploy). In conjunction
with Github Actions, an edit to files in a repository can now be used to
automatically deploy a change to configuration on a staging hub, where these
changes can be tested, without affecting the work of hub users. Then,
after verifying that the changes are the ones you want, another push and
Github Actions run updates the prod deployment of the hub. This configuration
(our example [here](https://github.com/learning-2-learn/l2lhub-deployment))
should increase robustness, and also allow others to suggest changes to the
deployment, by editing the relevant configuration files and making a pull
request.

The process of setting this up still required quite a bit of hand-holding on
Yuvi's part, but the hope is that this is something that will be as easy
to do as using the
[zero to jupyterhub](https://zero-to-jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
currently is.

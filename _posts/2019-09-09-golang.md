I have been hearing rumblings about Google's Go programming language for a
little while now. It sounds that the concurrency model is quite interesting and
I have been meaning to learn more about it for a while. This weekend I found the
opportunity to watch an excellent
[tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS4e4q9oBaU) on programming in the
language. This tutorial seems to have been designed for a learner like me:
plenty of opportunity to follow along with hands-on programming, and assuming a
fair amount of experience with the OS and with other programming. Having only
finished about a third of this tutorial, I am looking forward to see how
concurrency is implemented, after also taking a little break to watch a rather
compelling [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN_DpYBzKso) by Rob Pike, one
of the designers of the language, distinguising concurrency and parallelism.

While not clearly a good language for numerical computing, it seems that Golang
would be useful for managing distributed computing resources. I hope that I will
have some time to play around with it in the context of image processing,
through my participation in the [ImageXD](https://xd-con.org/imagexd-2019/)
workshop held at UC Berkeley this week.

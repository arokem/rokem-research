[Ariel Rokem](https://arokem.org) is a data scientist at the [University of
Washington eScience Institute](https://escience.washington.edu/).

Inspired by [Hogg's Research](http://hoggresearch.blogspot.com/), this web-page
is a record of Ariel's ongoing research.

My rules:

1. I must post once a week, except when on vacation.

2. Posts should be about the research and development that I am doing
